  "content": "Classical Mechanics\n1 Introduction\nClassical mechanics is important as it gives the foundation for most of physics. The theory, based\nonNewton\u0092 s laws of motion , provides essentially an exact description of almost all macroscopic\nphenomena. The theory requires modi\u0085cation for\n1.microscopic systems , e.g. atoms, molecules, nuclei - use quantum mechanics\n2.particles travelling at speeds close to the speed of light - userelativistic mechanics\nThese other theories must reduce to classical mechanics in the limit of large bodies travelling at speed\nmuch less than the speed of light.\nThe subject is usually divided into\n1.statics - systems at rest and in equilibrium ,\n2.kinematics - systems in motion, often accelerating. Concerned here with general relationships,\ne.g.F=dp\ndt, (Newton\u0092 s second law, without specifying the details of the force.)\n3.dynamics - details of the force law are speci\u0085ed, e.g. gravitational force, force due to a stretched\nspring.\n2 Newton\u0092 s laws of motion\nThese were formulated in his book Principia Mathematica in 1687. They are the basis of all classical\nmechanics.\n1. A body remains at rest or in a state of uniform motion (non-accelerating) unless acted on by an\nexternal force.\n2. Force = time rate of change of momentum, i.e.\nF=dp\ndt; (1)\nwhere p=mv= momentum of body of mass mmoving with velocity v. Ifmis constant then\nF=mdv\ndt=ma; (2)\nwith acceleration, a=dv\ndt.\n3. To every force (action ) there is an equal but opposite reaction .\nThese laws are only true in an inertial (non-accelerating) frame of reference . We shall discuss\nlater how we can treat motion relative to an accelerating frame of reference.\nFrom the second law, if F= 0, then the acceleration a=dv\ndt= 0, so the velocity, v, is constant. Thus\n\u0085rst law is special case of the second law.\nWe can also derive the third law from the second law as follows. Apply a force Fto body 1. Body 1\npushes on body 2 with force F2and body 2 pushes back on body 1 with force F1as shown in \u0085g 1.\nApplying Newton\u0092 s second law, for the combined system,\nF= (m1+m2)a: (3)\nFor body 1,\nF+F1=m1a; (4)\n1\n\nFigure 1: Demonstration of Newton\u0092 s Third Law\nfor body 2,\nF2=m2a: (5)\nAdding\nF+F1+F2= (m1+m2)a=F (6)\nF1+F2= 0 (7)\nand hence\nF1=\u0000F2: (8)\nSo that forces F1andF2are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction.\n3 Scalars and Vectors\nThere are two main types of variables in mechanics.\nScalar \u0096has only magnitude, e.g. mass, energy, speed.\nVector \u0096has magnitude and direction, e.g. position, velocity, acceleration, force.\nA vector may be represented graphically by a directed line segment. The length of the line represents\nthe magnitude of the vector, the direction of the line shows the direction of the vector. In printed text\nvectors are often written in bold type, and will be underlined in hand written text. A certain knowledge\nof vectors is assumed, in particular their Cartesian form.\nConsider Newton\u0092 s second law,\nF=ma: (9)\nThis is a vector equation which means that not only is the magnitudes on both sides of the equation\nequal, but the direction of the acceleration ais the same as the force, F. If we express Fandain\nCartesian form,\nF=Fx+Fy+Fz (10)\na=ax+ay+az; (11)\nthen\nFx=max=mdvx\ndt=md2x\ndt2; (12)\nFy=may=mdvy\ndt=md2y\ndt2; (13)\nFz=maz=mdvz\ndt=md2z\ndt2: (14)\n2\n\n4 Units and Dimensions\nIn order to discuss concepts such as velocity, force energy, etc. we must introduce a standard set of units\nof the fundamental variables or dimensions. The fundamental variables are mass [M], length [L]and\ntime [T]. The most widely used set of units for these variables is the Syst\u00e8me International (S.I.).\nThe base units of the S.I. system are\nvariable unit name abbreviation\nmass [M]kilogram kg\nlength [L]metre m\ntime [T] second s\nFrom these base units we can obtain derived units for other variables, e.g. speed = distance/time, with\ndimensions of speed [v] = [L]=[T]and the S.I. unit is m/s, or ms\u00001. For force = mass \u0002acceleration\nthe dimensions are [F] = [m] [L] [T]\u00002and the unit is kg m s\u00002= Newton ( N). Units have dimensions\nandallequations in physics must be dimensionally homogeneous ; i.e. both sides and each term of\nthe equation must have the same dimensions. As an example,\n1. distance travelled in time tat constant speed viss=vt. The dimension are\n[L] = [L] [T]\u00001[T] = [L]: (15)\n2. distance travelled in time tunder a constant acceleration afrom an initial speed uis\ns=ut+1\n2at2: (16)\nThe dimensions are\n[L] = [ L] [T]\u00001[T] + [L] [T]\u00002[T]2(17)\n[L] = [ L] + [L]: (18)\nDimensional analysis of equations provides a very useful check on the correctness of algebraic expres-\nsions. However it does not give information about dimensionless constants, such as the1\n2in equation\n(16) above.\n5 Time rate of change of vectors\nNewton\u0092 s second law, F=mdv\ndt, involves the time rate of change of the velocity vector, v. Consider\nv=dr\ndt: (19)\nChange of position of particle in time interval \u0001tis\u0001r, so velocity (see \u0085g 2\nv= lim\n\u0001t!0\u0001r\n\u0001t=dr\ndt: (20)\nIn Cartesian coordinates\nr=xbi+ybj+zbk; (21)\nv=dr\ndt=dx\ndtbi+dy\ndtbj+dz\ndtbk; (22)\n=vxbi+vybj+vzbk: (23)\nThe speed of the particle is\nv=jvj=pv\u0001v=q\nv2x+v2y+v2z: (24)\n3\n\nFigure 2: Time-dependent vectors\nFor acceleration, replace rbyvin the above expressions,\na= lim\n\u0001t!0\u0001v\n\u0001t=dv\ndt: (25)\nIn Cartesian coordinates\na=vxbi+vybj+vzbk; (26)\na=dv\ndt=dvx\ndtbi+dvy\ndtbj+dvz\ndtbk; (27)\n=d2x\ndt2bi+d2y\ndt2bj+d2z\ndt2bk: (28)\n6 Motion in one dimension\nConsider a particle of mass, m, moving along the positive x-axis as in \u0085g 3.\nFigure 3: Motion along x-axis\nThe velocity is positive for motion in sense of xincreasing and negative for xdecreasing.\nIn time dtdistance travelled by particle is dx=vdt. In the \u0085nite time interval between t1, when\nposition of particle is x1, and time t2when position is x2, distance travelled is\ns= (x2\u0000x1) =Zt2\nt1vdt: (29)\nThis is represented by the shaded area in \u0085g 4(a). We need to know how vvaries with tin order to\ncalculate s.\n4\n\nFigure 4: (a) Left: Velocity - time graph; (b) Right: Acceleration - time graph\nSimilarly for acceleration, a, the change in velocity in time interval between time t1andt2is\n(v2\u0000v1) =Zt2\nt1adt; (30)\nand is represented by the shaded area in \u0085g 4(b). As before we need to know how avaries as a function\nof time.\n7 Motion under a constant force\nIf the force is constant, then by Newton\u0092 s second law, F=ma, then so is the acceleration. Hence from\n\u0085g 3\nv2=v1+a(t2\u0000t1); (31)\nv=at+K (32)\nwhere Kis an arbitrary constant of integration. Suppose v=uatt= 0, this is a boundary orinitial\ncondition , so\nv=u+at (33)\ndx\ndt=u+at (34)\nand integrating gives\nx=ut+1\n2at2+K2; (35)\nwhere K 2is another constant of integration determined by another boundary (initial) condition. Suppose\nx=x0att= 0, then\nx=x0+ut+1\n2at2(36)\nand distance travelled in time t, is\ns= (x\u0000x0) =ut+1\n2at2: (37)\nSince t= (v\u0000u)=a, then\ns=u(v\u0000u)\na+1\n2a\u0014(v\u0000u)\na\u00152\n(38)\n5\n\nand re-arranging,\nv2=u2+ 2as (39)\nCollecting together the equations of motion we have for linear motion under a constant acceleration (or\nforce)\nv=u+at; (40)\ns=ut+1\n2at2; (41)\nv2=u2+ 2as; (42)\ns=1\n2(u+v)t: (43)\n7.1 Free fall under gravity\nIn this case the constant acceleration is downwards, with a=\u0000g, asx,v, and aare positive when\nmeasured upwards. Consider a body thrown upwards with an initial speed u. Forces are as shown in\nFigure 5: Mass falling freely under in\u0087 uence of gravity\n\u0085g 5. The initial conditions are, x= 0,v=uatt= 0. To \u0085nd the maximum height reached, we \u0085nd s\nwhere v= 0. Thus from eq(42), 0 =u2\u00002gsgiving s=u2=(2g). The time to the maximum height is\nfound using eq(40) giving t=u=g. To \u0085nd the time to reach some speci\u0085ed height, x1, then use eq(41),\nx1=ut\u00001\n2gt2(44)\ngt2\u00002ut+ 2x1= 0: (45)\nThis is a quadratic equation in t, with two roots,\nt=u\u0006p\nu2\u00002gx1\ng: (46)\nIfu2>2gx1, the body can reach a height greater than x1and the two roots are real, with\nt1=u\u0000p\nu2\u00002gx1\ng(47)\ngiving the time to reach x1on the way up and\nt2=u+p\nu2\u00002gx1\ng(48)\ngiving the time to reach height x1going down after reaching the maximum height. Note that t1andt2\nare symmetric about the time to maximum height t=u=g. Ifx1> u2=gno particle can reach this height\n(the two roots of the quadratic are complex quantities).\n6\n\n8 Force of friction\nConsider a block of mass msliding on a rough surface. The frictional force, Ff,as it acts on the\nblock , is in a direction opposite to the motion of the block. It acts at the surface of the block in contact\nwith the rough surface. The normal reaction ,N, of the surface on the block is perpendicular to the\nsurface. As there is no resultant vertical force on the block, (see \u0085g 6) then the magnitude\nFigure 6: Block sliding over rough horzontal surface\nN=mg: (49)\nIf the block is sliding the frictional force is proportional to the normal reaction. The constant of pro-\nportionality is called the coe\u00a2 cient of friction, often denoted by \u0016. Hence we write Ff=\u0016Nfor the\nmagnitude.\nSome typical values of \u0016aresurfaces \u0016\nsteel on steel 0.4\nte\u0087 on on te\u0087 on 0.04\nlead on steel 1\nIf applied force Fis not su\u00a2 ciently large to cause the block to slide, there is still a frictional force Ff\nacting in the direction opposite to that in which the body would move if there were no friction, but\nFf< \u0016N .\nIf the body is just about to slide we shall assume that Ff=\u0016N. In practice the coe\u00a2 cient of\nsliding friction is slightly less than the coe\u00a2 cient of static friction .\nConsider the motion of a block sliding on a rough horizontal surface. Resolving the forces vertically,\nmg\u0000N= 0 (50)\nso\nFf=\u0016N=\u0016mg (51)\nand the resultant horizontal force on the body is\n(F\u0000Ff) =ma=mdv\ndt: (52)\nThis is the equation of motion of the body.\nExample 1 Suppose body is initially sliding to the right and the applied force F= 0. The body slides\nto rest under the in\u0087 uence of the frictional force. Equation of motion is\n\u0000Ff=\u0000\u0016mg =ma; (53)\nso the acceleration\na=\u0000\u0016g (54)\n7\n\nis constant. Hence previous results for motion under a constant acceleration can be used. In particular\nthe time to come to rest if initial velocity is uis given by\n0 = u\u0000\u0016gt; (55)\nt=u=(\u0016g): (56)\n8.1 Motion of body on rough inclined plane\nConsider the body being pulled/pushed upthe plane at a constant speed. The forces are as in the\ndiagram, \u0085g 7. The body is sliding so we take frictional force Ff=\u0016N. There is no resultant force\nFigure 7: Mass pulled up an inclined plane\nperpendicular to the plane (it remains in contact) so\nN=mgcos\u000b: (57)\nResolving forces parallel to plane surface,\nF\u0000Ff\u0000mgsin\u000b=ma=mdv\ndt(58)\nF\u0000\u0016mg cos\u000b\u0000mgsin\u000b=mdv\ndt: (59)\nExample 2 What is largest value for the angle of inclination of the plane for which body remains at rest\non the plane without sliding down . In this case the body wants to slide down, so the frictional force Ff\nacts up the plane, as in \u0085g 8. For equilibrium there is no resultant force on the particle in any direction.\nFigure 8: Body sliding down an inclined plane\nResolving forces perpendicular to the plane\nN=mgcos\u000b (60)\n8\n\nand parallel to the plane\nFf=mgsin\u000b: (61)\nThe maximum value of Ffis\u0016N, so\nFf=\u0016N=\u0016mg cos\u000b (62)\nso the maximum value of \u000bis when\n\u0016mg cos\u000b=mgsin\u000b (63)\ntan\u000b=\u0016: (64)\n8.2 Role of friction in accelerating a car\nForces are as shown for a rear-wheel drive car in \u0085g 9. The frictional force between the rear wheels and\nFigure 9: Rear-wheel driven vehicle\nthe ground is Ff, and this force provides the force needed to accelerate the car, Ff=ma.\n9 Kinematical relations\nBefore considering other one-dimensional problems we need to develop some other general aspects of\nmechanics.\n9.1 Work\nForce Fis applied to a body. If point of application of the force, i.e. body moves a distance dras in \u0085g\n10, the work done by the force is de\u0085ned to be\ndW=F\u0001dr= (Fcos\u000b) dr (65)\nwhere Fcos\u000bis component of force in direction of motion of the body. Hence work is a scalar\nquantity .\nFor \u0085nite displacements of a particle from position r1tor2as in \u0085g 10 the work done bythe force is\nW=Zr2\nr1F\u0001dr (66)\nNote that Fmay vary with position.\n9\n\nFigure 10: Force displaced\nFigure 11: Body moving over curved path\nFor a constant force (in both magnitude anddirection ), work done is\nW=F\u0001(r2\u0000r1): (67)\nWork isenergy and the S.I. unit is the newton metre ( N m) .\nIf force acts in the x-direction and the particle can only move in the x-direction, then we can drop\nthe scalar product in eq(66) and write\nW=Zx2\nx1Fdx (68)\nas the work done by force Fin moving particle from position x1tox2.\nExample 3 Work that must be done to stretch a spring, as illustrated in \u0085g 12: Tension in the spring\nFigure 12: Stretched spring\nwhen extended is proportional to the (small) extension, (Hooke\u0092 s law), so T=\u0000kxwhere kis the sti\u00a4ness\nconstant. To stretch the spring we must apply a force F= +kx. The work done by force F(i.e. by us)\nto stretch spring to an extension x1is\nW=Zx1\n0Fdx=Zx1\n0kxdx=1\n2kx2\n1: (69)\n10\n\nWe assume there are no dissipative forces (e.g. friction) so this energy is stored in the stretched spring\naspotential energy . Potential energy will be discussed in more detail later.\nExample 4 Work done bygravity when particle falls from position x1tox2where (x1\u0000x2) =h. The\nFigure 13: Body falling through distance hunder gravity\nforce F=\u0000mgand the work\nW=Zx2\nx1Fdx=Zx2\nx1(\u0000mg) dx= (\u0000mgx )jx2\nx1=\u0000mg(x2\u0000x1) =mgh: (70)\nThe work done manifests itself as kinetic energy of the particle.\nExample 5 Suppose particle is constrained to fall under gravity inside a smooth tube, as in the \u0085g\n14. Force of tube onthe particle is Nand is normal to the tube. (The tube being smooth produces no\nFigure 14: Contrained motion of particle under gravity\nfrictional force - an idealized situation!) So resultant force on particle is N+F. Work done by these\nforces as particle moves a distance dralong the tube is\ndW= (N+F)\u0001dr=N\u0001dr+F\u0001dr: (71)\n11\n\nButNis orthogonal (perpendicular) to drat every point along tube, so N\u0001dr= 0. Hence\ndW=F\u0001dr (72)\nand constraining forces which are not dissipative (i.e. no friction) do no work. For this problem,\nF=\u0000mgbianddr= dxbi+ dybj, so\ndW=F\u0001dr=\u0000mgbi\u0001\u0010\ndxbi+ dybj\u0011\n=\u0000mgdx (73)\nand hence the work done by gravity when particle falls from height x1tox2is\nW=Zx2\nx1(\u0000mg) dx=mgh (74)\nas before.\n9.2 Power\nPower, P, is de\u0085ned as the rate of doing work,\nP=dW\ndt: (75)\nThe S.I. unit is the joule/second\u0000\nJ s\u00001\u0001\nor watt ( W). Since dW=F\u0001drthen\nP=dW\ndt=F\u0001dr\ndt=F\u0001v=Fxvx+Fyvy+Fzvz: (76)\nAverage power over extended time interval tisP=W=t, where Wis work done in time t.\n9.3 Impulse\nConsider a force Fwhich acts on a body of mass mduring a time interval from t1tot2. The impulse (a\nvector quantity) of Fduring this time interval is de\u0085ned as\nI=Zt2\nt1Fdt (77)\nBut from Newton\u0092 s second law\nF=dp\ndt(78)\nso\nI=Zt2\nt1dp\ndtdt=Zp2\np1dp= (p2\u0000p1) (79)\nwhere p1=mv1, the momentum of particle at time t, and similarly p2=mv2at time t2. Hence\nNewton\u0092 s second law can also be stated as Impulse = change in momentum,\nI= \u0001p= (p2\u0000p1): (80)\nIf force, F, is constant (in direction and magnitude) throughout the time interval \u0001t= (t2\u0000t1), then\nI=F(t2\u0000t1) =F\u0001t: (81)\nAn important special case is when force, F, is very large and \u0001tis very small, so that I= \u0001pis \u0085nite.\nNote as I=Rt2\nt1Fdtthen\nF=dp\ndt=dI\ndt(82)\nExample 6 Particle of mass mbouncing o\u00a4 a wall elastically (no loss of kinetic energy) as in \u0085g 15.\nChange in momentum of particle is \u0001p= (\u0000mv)\u0000mv=\u00002mvis the impulse on the particle. Therefore\nby Newton\u0092 s third law the impulse on the wall is +2mv.\n12\n\nFigure 15: Particle bouncing elastically from a wall (very large mass)\n9.4 Kinetic energy and potential energy\nConsider a one-dimensional problem with the force Fin the x-direction acting on a particle of mass m.\nThe equation of motion is\nF=ma=mdv\ndt=mdv\ndxdx\ndt=mvdv\ndx: (83)\nThe work done by the force in moving the particle from position x1to position x2in \u0085g 16 is\nFigure 16: Work done between two points\nW=Zx2\nx1Fdx=Zx2\nx1mvdv\ndxdx=Zv2\nv1mvdv=1\n2mv2jv2\nv1=1\n2mv2\n2\u00001\n2mv2\n1; (84)\nwhere v1is velocity of particle at position x1and similarly at position 2. We de\u0085ne kinetic energy\n(K.E.) as KE=1\n2mv2. Hence the work done by the force is equal to the change (increase) in kinetic\nenergy.\nWe can also consider the work done by the force as the di\u00a4erence inpotential energy (P.E.)\nbetween positions x1andx2, thus we de\u0085ne (mechanical) potential V(x)by\nW=Zx2\nx1Fdx=V(x1)\u0000V(x2) =\u0000[V(x2)\u0000V(x1)] =1\n2mv2\n2\u00001\n2mv2\n1 (85)\nand\nV(x1) +1\n2mv2\n1=V(x2) +1\n2mv2\n2: (86)\nThe above relationship only de\u0085nes the di\u00a4erence in potential energy. To de\u0085ne an absolute\npotential energy of a particle at x1we need an arbitrary but conveniently chosen position, x0, at which\nthe potential V= 0by de\u0085nition. Then\nV(x1) =Zx0\nx1Fdx (87)\nand\nV(x1)\u0000V(x2) =Zx0\nx1Fdx\u0000Zx0\nx2Fdx=Zx0\nx1Fdx+Zx2\nx0Fdx=Zx2\nx1Fdx=W: (88)\n13\n\nSince\nV(x1) +1\n2mv2\n1=V(x2) +1\n2mv2\n2 (89)\nthen potential energy + kinetic energy is constant, i.e. total energy is constant. Hence total energy ,\nE=V+KE,is conserved throughout the motion provided force Fis non-dissipative (i.e. no friction).\nIf we know the potential energy as a function of position, V(x)we can determine the force Ffrom\nF=\u0000dV\ndx: (90)\nNote Fis in the direction of decreasing V.\nExample 7 Gravitational force F=\u0000mg. Then\nFigure 17: Particle falling under gravity\nV(x1) =Zx0\nx1Fdx=Zx0\nx1(\u0000mg) dx= (\u0000mgx )jx0\nx1=mgx 1\u0000mgx 0: (91)\nWe can choose x0= 0as the ground, giving\nV(x) =mgx (92)\nand\nF=\u0000dV\ndx=\u0000mg (93)\nas above.\nExample 8 Equation for motion under constant acceleration of gravity given earlier,\nv2=u2\u00002g(x\u0000x0) (94)\ncan be re-written by multiplying by1\n2mas\n1\n2mv2=1\n2mu2\u00001\n2m2g(x\u0000x0) (95)\n1\n2mv2+mgx =1\n2mu2+mgx 0 (96)\ni.e. conservation of total energy.\nIn three-dimensions we have\nW=Zr2\nr1F\u0001dr=1\n2mv2\n2\u00001\n2mv2\n1: (97)\n14\n\nalso\nW=V(r1)\u0000V(r2) = change of P :E: (98)\nand\nV(r1) =Zr0\nr1F\u0001dr (99)\nV(r0) = 0 (100)\nF=\u0000rV (101)\nwhere the gradient operator\nr\u0011bi@\n@x+bj@\n@y+bk@\n@z: (102)\nWe can only write F=\u0000rVand de\u0085ne a potential energy function V(r)for a non-dissipative or\nconservative force. A conservative force is one such that the work done by the force in moving the\nparticle from position r1tor2isindependent of the path between r1andr2, see \u0085g 18 The work\nFigure 18: Work done over di\u00a4erent paths by a conservative force\ndone just depends on the initial and end points,\nWAB=W=ZrB\nrAF\u0001dr=V(rA)\u0000V(rB): (103)\nExamples of conservative forces are: electrostatics, gravitation, force due to a stretched spring.\n10 Simple Harmonic motion\nConsider a particle of mass mattached to a light (massless) spring with a displacement xfrom the\nequilibrium (unstretched) position x= 0 as shown in \u0085g 19. Positive xmeans extension, negative x\nmeans compression of the spring. The restoring force is given by Hooke\u0092 s law, F=\u0000kx.

If r0is the separation\nfor minimum potential energy, (the equilibrium separation), the two atoms vibrate about this value r0.\n17\n\nFigure 22: Potential energy curve for simple harmonic motion\n1.25 1.125 1 0.875 0.75 0.62575\n50\n25\n0\n-25\n-50\n-75\n-100rV\nrV\nFigure 23: Potential energy curve as a function of the separation of two atoms\nThis can be shown by taking a Taylor\u0092 s series expansion about the equilibrium position.

However\nthe mass of the Sun, M, is \u0085nite and therefore the Sun and planet both move with respect to their overall\ncentre of mass. The centre of mass is at point O in \u0085g 58 such that\n48\n\nFigure 58: Rotation about centre of mass of two bodies\nR=M\n(M+m)r: (362)\nThe acceleration of mrelative to O is\na=d2R\ndt2=M\n(M+m)d2r\ndt2: (363)\nThus the equation of motion of the planet is\nF=ma=mM\n(M+m)d2r\ndt2=\u0016d2r\ndt2: (364)\nThat is the same as a particle of mass\n\u0016=mM\n(M+m)< m (365)\nat a position rrelative to the \u0085xed point O (centre of mass).

The observer can express position ,velocity andacceleration of a particle relative to this\nframe of reference . We want to consider transformations of these quantities between di\u00a4erent frames\nof reference. This is particularly important in the theory of relativity .\nConsider one frame of reference S, \u0085xed relative to the Earth and another frame of reference S0\u0085xed\nrelative to a car moving with constant velocity valong the x-axis, as in \u0085g 60.

Ship 1 is travelling with constant velocity u1on a given\nbearing. Ship 2 is travelling at a constant speed u2. We need to determine the bearing (direction)\nof ship 2 such that the two ships will intercept, given that the ships are at known positions AandB\nrespectively at time t. What must angle \fbe for interception in \u0085g 64? Consider motion of ship 2 relative\nto ship 1, i.e. u0\n2=u2\u0000u1. For interception ship 2 must appear relative to ship 1 to be travelling along\nthe direction BtoA. Thus u0\n2=u2\u0000u1is in direction\u0000 \u0000 !BA.

Suppose now that the car is\nalso accelerating relative to the Earth, then\ndu0\ndt=du\ndt\u0000dv\ndt; (402)\nwithdu0\ndtbeing the acceleration of the bird relative to the car,du\ndtbeing the acceleration of the bird\nrelative to the Earth, anddv\ndtbeing the acceleration of the car relative to the Earth. The force on the\nbird necessary to accelerate it in frame S (Earth) is\nF=mdu\ndt: (403)\nThe equation of motion of the bird in the reference frame of the car, S0, isNOT\nF=mdu0\ndt: (404)\nIt is correctly\nF0=mdu\ndt\u0000mdv\ndt; (405)\ni.e. the e\u00a4ective force on the bird in the car\u0092 s frame of reference, S0, is\nF0=F\u0000ma; (406)\nwhere a=dv\ndtis the acceleration of the car (in frame S). Thus if we want to apply Newton\u0092 s laws of\nmotion in an accelerating frame we must add to the real force Fthe\u0085ctitious force (\u0000ma). An\naccelerating frame of reference is also called a non-inertial frame. An inertial (or non-accelerating)\nframe of reference is one in which Newton\u0092 s laws of motion apply without needing to introduce \u0085ctitious\nforces.\n54\n\n20 Rotating frame of reference\nConsider a person standing on a rotating roundabout as in \u0085g 67. Real force of friction at the feet\nFigure 67: Observer in a rotating frame\nprovides the centripetal acceleration r!2, therefore F=mr!2.Relative to the roundabout the\nperson is at rest under the in\u0087 uence of a real centripetal force F=mr!2and a \u0085ctitious centrifugal\nforce F=mr!2acting through the centre of mass. If !is large enough, the person may fall over\noutwards under the in\u0087 uence of these two forces, which constitute a couple acting on the person (see\nsection on rotational motion and couples later).\n20.1 Geostationary satellite\nSatellite appears stationary relative to an observer on a rotating Earth as shown in \u0085g 67.

To observer Athe path of the bird is a straight line. Relative to observer Bon the\n55\n\nFigure 69: Observers in rotaing and inertial frames\nroundabout the path of the bird is curved. Hence observer Bassumes there is a transverse horizontal\nforce Fcoracting on the bird de\u0087 ecting the bird to the right for the given sense of rotation. This is the\nCoriolis force .\nThe general expression for the Coriolis force is\nFcor=\u00002m!\u0002v; (409)\nwhere !is the angular velocity vector of rotating frame, vis velocity of particle of mass mrelative to\nthe rotating frame of reference. Note Fcoris perpendicular to both !andvand so always transverse to\nthe direction of motion. There are several interesting consequences of the Coriolis force:\nConsider the e\u00a4ect of the rotating Earth:\nThrow a ball horizontally due East at three di\u00a4erent places on the Earth\u0092 s surface, A,B, and Cas in\n\u0085g 70 - dotted line is the local horizontal at each place on the Earth. In the northern hemisphere (point\nA) the Coriolis force de\u0087 ects the ball to the right as it has a component in this direction. On the equator\n(point B) the Coriolis force has no horizontal component so the ball is not de\u0087 ected. (Coriolis force is\nvertical so a\u00a4ects the local e\u00a4ective force due to gravity.) In the southern hemisphere the ball is de\u0087 ected\nto the left.\nWeather systems are determined by the Coriolis force. Wind blows anticlockwise (clockwise) around\nregion of low pressure in the northern (southern) hemispheres. Winds blow approximately along isobars\ninstead of down the pressure gradient.\nOne should set the size of the Coriolis force on the rotating Earth into context. The maximum value\nof the Coriolis acceleration is a=\u00002!v. Since != (2\u0019)=(24\u000260\u000260) rad s\u00001= 7:272 2\u000210\u00005rad s\u00001\nthen for a speed of 15 m s\u00001('33 mph) ,a= 2:2\u000210\u00003m s\u00002, (quite small compared to the vertical\ncomponent of acceleration due to gravity on the Earth\u0092 s surface).\n20.3 Simple derivation of expression for Coriolis force\nConsider a massless smooth rod on which there is a small ring of mass m. The rod is rotating with\nconstant angular velocity !in a horizontal plane. As the rod is smooth there can be no radial force (from\nfriction) on the ring. The only force on the ring is a transverse normal reaction force Nas shown in \u0085g\n71.\n56\n\nFigure 70: E\u00a4ect of Coriolis force at Earth\u0092 s surface\nFigure 71: Diagram for simple derivation of expression for Coriolis force\nThe equation of motion of the ring is, relative to the inertial reference frame,\nma=N (410)\nm\u0014\u0012\n::r\u0000r:\n\u00122\u0013\nbr+\u0010\n2:r:\n\u0012+r::\n\u0012\u0011\nb\u0012\u0015\n=Nb\u0012: (411)\nTherefore the radial equation of motion is\nm\u0012\n::r\u0000r:\n\u00122\u0013\n= 0 (412)\nand the transverse one is\nm\u0010\n2:r:\n\u0012+r::\n\u0012\u0011\n=N: (413)\nBut:\n\u0012=!=constant, so\nm\u0000::r\u0000r!2\u0001\n= 0 ; (414)\n2m\u0001r! =N: (415)\n57\n\nNow consider the equation of motion of the ring relative to the rotating rod. In this frame the ring can\nonly move in one dimension along the rod. If we work in this frame we must add to the real forces the\n\u0085ctitious centrifugal force Fcand, because the ring is moving relative to the rotating frame, the Coriolis\nforce Fcoras in \u0085g 72 In the rotating frame the equations of motion is radially\nFigure 72: Forces on ring in inertial and rotating frames\nm\u0001\u0001r=Fc (416)\nand transversely,\nN\u0000Fcor= 0 (417)\nas there is no transverse motion in the rotating frame. Comparing eq(414) with eq(416) gives a centrifugal\nforce\nFc=mr!2(418)\nand comparing eq(415) and eq(417) gives a Coriolis force\nFcor= 2m\u0001r!: (419)\nIn the rotating frame the ring has only radial velocity v=\u0001r. Thus the magnitude of the Coriolis force\nFcor= 2mv!: (420)\nThe direction of Fcorand its magnitude is consistent with the general expression quoted previously, i.e.\nFcor=\u00002m!\u0002v (421)\nas!is out of the page and vis along the rod.\n21 Angular momentum and torques\nParticle of mass mhas velocity vat position vector ras in \u0085g 73. The angular momentum is de\u0085ned\nby\nL=r\u0002p=mr\u0002v (422)\nabout point O. The direction of Lis given by the usual right-hand rule for a vector product.\nConsider a force Facting on the particle. The torque ormoment of force about point Oisde\u0085ned\nby\n\u001c=r\u0002F: (423)\nBut\nF=mdv\ndt(424)\n58\n\nFigure 73: Position and velocity vectors for rotational motion\nso\n\u001c=mr\u0002dv\ndt: (425)\nConsider\nd (r\u0002v)\ndt=dr\ndt\u0002v+r\u0002dv\ndt(426)\n=v\u0002v+r\u0002dv\ndt= 0 + r\u0002dv\ndt(427)\nd (r\u0002v)\ndt=r\u0002dv\ndt(428)\nand therefore\n\u001c=mr\u0002dv\ndt=md (r\u0002v)\ndt=d (mr\u0002v)\ndt(429)\n\u001c=dL\ndt: (430)\nHence torque is equal to the rate of change of angular momentum . This is analogous to the\nlinear case of force equal to rate of change of linear momentum, i.e. Newton\u0092 s second law. If \u001c=0thenL\nis constant in magnitude and direction. If \u001c=0then either force F= 0orr\u0002Fin which case force Fand\nrare parallel and the force is a central force. Thus Lis constant for any central force, F(r) =F(r)br.\nFor a system in equilibrium, L= 0and constant so there is no net torque about any point. This is\nthe basis of taking moments to determine the magnitude of forces.\nExample 16 A massless beam is supported at points AandBand masses m1andm2are attached as in\nthe \u0085g 74.

Any higher acceleration than this will cause the\ncar to somersault backwards. For a front-wheel drive car, maximum acceleration occurs for F=ma=\n\u0016N2. The front wheels can never leave the ground because they will skid \u0085rst.\n22 Systems of particles - properties of centre of mass\nConsider a system of nparticles of masses, mi(i= 1;2; : : : ; n )at position vectors ri(i= 1;2; : : : ; n )as\nshown in \u0085g 77. Total mass is\nM=nX\ni=1mi: (443)\nThecentre of mass is at position\nR=Pn\ni=1miriPn\ni=1mi=Pn\ni=1miri\nM: (444)\nThe position Ris such that if the total mass Mwere at Rit would have the same moment about origin\nOas the actual system, i.e.\nMR=nX\ni=1miri: (445)\nThe centre of mass is therefore that point about which a rigid body will balance if in a uniform gravita-\ntional \u0085eld.\n61\n\nFigure 77: System of particles acted on by forces\nIf the system of particles is not subjected to any external forces the centre of mass remains at\nrest or in uniform motion , i.e. no acceleration of the centre of mass. This is true even if the particles\nin the system are moving relative to each other and interact with each other. Also, if system of particles\nis subjected to external forces the centre of mass behaves as if all the forces acted at that\nposition . In addition, any \u0085ctitious force appears to act at through the centre of mass.\nProof. LetFibe force on i-th particle, then\nFi=Fiext+Fiint; (446)\nwhere Fiextis external force on particle i, and Fiintis the internal force on particle idue to internal\ninteractions with all other particles. The equation of motion of particle iis\nFi=mid2ri\ndt2(447)\nand the resultant force on the system is\nF=nX\ni=1Fi=nX\ni=1mid2ri\ndt2=d2\ndt2 nX\ni=1miri!\n(448)\nF=d2\ndt2(MR) =Md2R\ndt2: (449)\nTherefore the centre of mass moves as if all the forces act on a mass Mat the position of the centre of\nmass.\nSince\nF=nX\ni=1Fi=nX\ni=1Fiext+nX\ni=1Fiint (450)\nandnX\ni=1Fiint= 0 (451)\nby Newton\u0092 s third law, we have\nF=nX\ni=1Fi=Md2R\ndt2: (452)\n62\n\nTherefore only external forces in\u0087 uence the motion of the centre of mass. If F= 0(no resultant external\nforce) then\nd2R\ndt2= 0 (453)\nand velocity of centre of massdR\ndtis constant.\n23 Rigid bodies\n23.1 Centre of mass\nRigid bodies can be considered as a system of particles rigidly joined together. An example is a uniform\nthin rod of length Land mass Mas in \u0085g 78. We can determine the position of the centre of mass as\nFigure 78: Uniform thin rod\nfollows:\nMass per unit length is\n\u001b=M\nL(454)\nso the mass of an element of length dxisdm=\u001bdx. Therefore from the de\u0085nition, the position of the\ncentre of mass is given by\nX=RL\n0xdm\nRL\n0dm=RL\n0x \u001bdx\nRL\n0\u001bdx=1\n2\u001bx2jL\n0\nM=1\n2\u001bL2\nM=1\n2\u001bL2\nM=1\n2M\nLL2\nM=1\n2L (455)\nas might have been expected. Note this procedure works even when \u001bis not constant.\nExample 19 Position of centre of mass of a thin wedge shaped rod (as shown in \u0085g 79) where the mass\nper unit length is proportional to distance from one end, i.e. \u001b=kxwith ka constant.

Let !be the angular velocity. A mass element miis at a perpendicular distance rifrom the pivot.\nThe only velocity is transverse to this direction of magnitude vi=!ri. For a rigid body, all elements\nmust have the same angular velocity.

(464)\nwhere direction of vector is along the axis of rotation in a sense given by a right-handed screw.\n23.4 Correspondence between rotational and translational motion\nThe previous sections show that we can establish a table of correspondences between quantities related\nto linear motion and to rotational motion.\nLinear Rotation\nmass m I moment of inertia\nvelocity v ! angular velocity\nlinear momentum p=mv L =I! angular momentum\nlinear kinetic energy1\n2mv2 1\n2I!2rotational kinetic energy\nforce F=dp\ndt\u001c=dL\ndttorque\nF=mdv\ndtF=Id!\ndt\n23.5 Compound pendulum\nThe mass of the body is M.

Two important theorems help us\ndetermine moments of inertia. These theorems are called (a) the theorem of perpendicular axes\nand (b) the theorem of parallel axes.\n23.7 Theorem of perpendicular axes\nIt is important to note that this theorem only applies to plane lamina . Consider a lamina (sheet)\nlying in the x\u0000yplane, with mass per unit area \u001a(not necessarily constant) as shown in \u0085g 84. Mass\nof an element of area dxdyisdm=\u001adxdy.

Similarly the second integral\n67\n\nFigure 84: Diagram for perpendicular axes theorem of moments of inertia\nFigure 85: Diagram for identi\u0085cation of integrals\ngives Ixthe moment of inertia of the lamina about the x-axis. Therefore\nIz=Ix+Iy: (485)\nNote the xandyaxes can be chosen anywhere in the lamina, but the z-axismust be taken through the\npoint of intersection of the xandyaxes.\n23.8 Theorem of parallel axes\nThis theorem applies to any solid body. Consider any axis through the centre of mass. Let I0be the\nmoment of inertia of the body about this axis. Now consider a parallel axis at a distance afrom the\naxis through the centre of mass (see \u0085g 86). The moment of inertia about a given axis depends only\non the perpendicular distance from the axis of each mass element. Therefore we may squash the three-\ndimensional body down onto a plane perpendicular to the axis. Suppose this is the x\u0000yplane. Then\nthe distance of an element from the axis through Oisrand\nr2=x2+y2; (486)\nand\na2=a2\nx+a2\ny: (487)\n68\n\nFigure 86: Diagram for parallel axes theorem of moments of inertia\nDistance from Ato mass element is Rsuch that\nR2= (x+ax)2+ (y+ay)2: (488)\nMoment of inertia of body about axis through Operpendicular to the x\u0000yplane is\nI0=Z\nvolr2dm=Z\nvol\u0000\nx2+y2\u0001\ndm (489)\nand the total mass\nM=Z\ndm: (490)\nMoment of inertia about parallel axis through Ais\nIA=Z\nvolR2dm (491)\n=Z\nvolh\n(x+ax)2+ (y+ay)2i\ndm (492)\n=Z\nvol\u0002\u0000\nx2+y2\u0001\n+\u0000\na2\nx+a2\ny\u0001\n+ 2xax+ 2yay\u0003\ndm (493)\nIA=Z\nvol\u0000\nx2+y2\u0001\ndm+a2Z\ndm+ 2axZ\nxdm+ 2ayZ\nydm: (494)\nBut by de\u0085nition of the centre of mass\nZ\nxdm=Z\nydm= 0 (495)\nand so\nIA=I0+Ma2: (496)\nThis theorem is true for any body.\nExample 20 Consider previous example of a uniform rod of length L. We showed explicitly that I0=\n1\n12ML2. Thus by the parallel axes theorem the moment of inertia about a parallel axis through one end\nof the rod is IA=I0+M\u0000L\n2\u00012=1\n3ML2as explicitly shown previously.\n69\n\n23.9 Kinetic energy of rigid body with rotation and translation\nWe shall \u0085nd an expression for the kinetic energy of a body which is rotating through its centre of mass\nand also is in rectilinear motion.

The kinetic energy of rotation about axis through centre of mass is1\n2I0!2. Kinetic energy of\nrectilinear motion is1\n2Mv2. Thus the total kinetic energy is simply\nKE=1\n2I0!2+1\n2Mv2: (497)\nConsider a wheel rolling on a surface without skidding .

Therefore the wheel can be considered as momentarily rotating\nabout point A(the point of contact with the surface) with angular velocity !. The moment of inertia\n70\n\nabout axis through centre of mass of the wheel (ring) perpendicular to the wheel is I0=MR2.

Density of the liquid\nis\u001a. There is no horizontal net force so forces on each pair of opposite parallel vertical faces must cancel.\nHence if P1is average pressure on face 1, and P2is average pressure on face 2, then force on face 1 is\ndF1=P1dydz (518)\n73\n\nFigure 93: Small element of volume of a \u0087 uid\nand force of face 2 is\ndF2=P2dydz (519)\nbutdF1= dF2and hence P1=P2. Therefore pressure is same at all points of same depth .\nConsider forces on upper and lower horizontal faces. Downward force on top force is\ndF5=Pdxdz: (520)\nUpward force on bottom face is\ndF6= (P+ dP) dxdz: (521)\nTherefore for equilibrium of mass of liquid \u001a(dxdydz),\ndF6\u0000dF5=\u001a(dxdydz)g; (522)\ndPdxdz=\u001a(dxdydz)g (523)\ndP=\u001agdy : (524)\nOn integrating\nP=\u001agy+P0; (525)\nwhere P0is pressure at y= 0.

Again upthrust equals weight of liquid displaced. For equilibrium\nmg= upthrust + N: (533)\nWhether body is partially or fully immersed there is an upthrust equal to weight of \u0087 uid displaced. This\nisArchimedes\u0092Principle . The result applies to any shape of body.\n24.2 Hydrodynamics - \u0087 uids in motion\nConsider an ideal liquid which is\n1. incompressible,\n2. non-viscous,\n3. constant temperature throughout,\n4. \u0087 owing steadily, i.e. no time variation in \u0087 ow pattern,\n5. non-turbulent.\nAt each point with coordinates (x; y; z )the liquid has a velocity vector vand pressure p(scalar).\nConsider following a small element of liquid as it travels along, as in \u0085g 97. The velocity may change in\nmagnitude and direction along the path. This path of a \u0087 uid element is called a streamline . Consider\nanother \u0087 uid element. This will follow another streamline. Two streamlines can never cross because\nit would mean that the velocity vector would have two di\u00a4erent directions at the same point which is\nimpossible (see \u0085g 98).\nFlow along stream lines, with the velocity vector changing smoothly is called streamline \u0087 ow .\nConsider a thin bundle of adjacent streamlines as in \u0085g 99 forming a stream tube . Because streamlines\ncannot cross any \u0087 uid that enters a stream tube at end A must exit through end B. There is no loss of\n\u0087 uid through the side of the stream tube.\n76\n\nFigure 97: A streamline\nFigure 98: Two streamlines\nFigure 99: A streamtube\n77\n\nIf density of \u0087 uid at A is \u001a1and density at B is \u001a2, mass of \u0087 uid entering tube at A in time tis\nm1=\u001a1v1tdA1and the mass of \u0087 uid leaving through end B is m2=\u001a2v2tdA2.

The theory, based\nonNewton\u0092 s laws of motion , provides essentially an exact description of almost all macroscopic\nphenomena. The theory requires modi\u0085cation for\n1.microscopic systems , e.g. atoms, molecules, nuclei - use quantum mechanics\n2.particles travelling at speeds close to the speed of light - userelativistic mechanics\nThese other theories must reduce to classical mechanics in the limit of large bodies travelling at speed\nmuch less than the speed of light.\nThe subject is usually divided into\n1.statics - systems at rest and in equilibrium ,\n2.kinematics - systems in motion, often accelerating. Concerned here with general relationships,\ne.g.F=dp\ndt, (Newton\u0092 s second law, without specifying the details of the force.)\n3.dynamics - details of the force law are speci\u0085ed, e.g. gravitational force, force due to a stretched\nspring.\n2 Newton\u0092 s laws of motion\nThese were formulated in his book Principia Mathematica in 1687. They are the basis of all classical\nmechanics.\n1. A body remains at rest or in a state of uniform motion (non-accelerating) unless acted on by an\nexternal force.\n2. Force = time rate of change of momentum, i.e.\nF=dp\ndt; (1)\nwhere p=mv= momentum of body of mass mmoving with velocity v. Ifmis constant then\nF=mdv\ndt=ma; (2)\nwith acceleration, a=dv\ndt.\n3. To every force (action ) there is an equal but opposite reaction .\nThese laws are only true in an inertial (non-accelerating) frame of reference . We shall discuss\nlater how we can treat motion relative to an accelerating frame of reference.\nFrom the second law, if F= 0, then the acceleration a=dv\ndt= 0, so the velocity, v, is constant. Thus\n\u0085rst law is special case of the second law.\nWe can also derive the third law from the second law as follows. Apply a force Fto body 1. Body 1\npushes on body 2 with force F2and body 2 pushes back on body 1 with force F1as shown in \u0085g 1.\nApplying Newton\u0092 s second law, for the combined system,\nF= (m1+m2)a: (3)\nFor body 1,\nF+F1=m1a; (4)\n1",
